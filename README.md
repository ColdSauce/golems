# Golems

golems is a rougelike game that teaches kids about logic and programming. A person starts with a robot that they can program before they get into combat. The robot, then, becomes completely autonomous during a Pokemon type of battle. Although golems is intended to be run on the [OLPC XO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO), it can be played on any modern operating system.
